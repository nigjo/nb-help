# NetBeans Browser Help Displayer

An attempt to replace the JavaHelp System in Apache NetBeans.

This is a stand-alone module to use in Apache NetBeans IDE or another
Rich Client Application based on the Apache NetBeans Platform.

The project is currently in an early alpha state. This means there is no "release"
yet, and the API may change in any direction.
